Yesterday was my first chance to get out and ride in 2013. Or more accurately, yesterday was the first time I had mustered the motivation to brave the cold and damp conditions get out on my bike and ride. I was shocked at how much the turkey and Christmas pud had slowed me down. That and the two months off the bike.

The ride was a pretty standard training ride for me. A ride that I often managed to squeeze in in the evening after work in the lighter months. You can see the route below. The most notable climb is the <a href="http://app.strava.com/activities/36248657#586781315">Flauden Hill</a> segment.

This is a ride I know well and as such it was clear that the cold and particularly wet weather we have had recently has had an affect on the roads. Many new potholes had appeared and existing holes had gotten bigger. As well as this there was noticeably more debris on the road, which makes cornering and descending more treacherous. So, what can cyclists and other road users do about the decaying state of our roads? 

<a href="http://www.fillthathole.org.uk/">Fill that hole</a>! Local councils have a duty to maintain roads to keep them safe for **all road users**, but they can only repair holes that they are notified about. Fill that hole is an easy way report potholes to your local authority via a web form. They Even have an I-Phone app that you could use while out on your ride. 

The next time your out on the road and you get a snake-bite puncture or damage a wheel or get annoyed at having to hell "HOLES" every two minutes on a group ride, remember the location and report it when you return. I would encourage every road user to get on and <a href="http://www.fillthathole.org.uk/hazards/report">report</a> that pothole, sunken manhole cover or any road hazard so it can be fixed. Any pothole is a goal.
