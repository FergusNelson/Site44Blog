It's that time of year again and the cycling media is a buzz with talk of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Giro_d%27Italia">Giro D'Italia</a>. The coverage especially in the United Kingdom has definitely stepped up a notch from from last year, and of good reason. Bradley Wiggins is making his long anticipated return to the Giro after vowing to never ride it again in 2010.

I have my doubts as to whether Wiggo can pull off his and Team Sky's Italian Job, but I am excited at the prospect of watching him try. Wiggins joins the Giro without a win for the 2013 season, which is in stark contrast to his 2012 build up to his Tour win where he won almost everything he entered. Put that together with the fact that Wiggin's form that traditionally been quite peaky and I have to say the Wiggins is not my favourite for the Giro.

Stage one Set out with thrills and spills with multiple crashes and a scintillating sprint finish by the immacualte manxman Mark Cavendish. The 130 km was a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criterium">crit</a> style stage in the centre to Napoli, with the riders completeing laps of a 8km circuit with multiple tight corners to navigate. I found the crit style a refreshing addition to the grand tour and of course it must have made fantastic viewing to the cycling fans of Napoli.

The stage came down to an out and out sprint with Mark Cavendish and Viviani the main protagonists. Cav lost the wheel of the leading group after a mechanical from his lead out man and had to make a huge effort to get back on the wheel. Later he seems to get boxed in slightly by a Nissan Radioshack rider, but emerged on full after boost to take the win from Viviani by half a bike.

Stage 2 brings us the 17.4 km team time trial on the island of Ischia.
